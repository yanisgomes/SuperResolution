# SuperResolution
The GitHub repository for this project contains code and documentation for implementing super-resolution techniques using MATLAB, focusing on enhancing image quality by correcting deficiencies in low-resolution images through alignment, overlay, deconvolution, and optimization methods such as least squares and regularized least squares.
